Overview
Huffman Coding: A data compression algorithm that uses variable-length codes for encoding characters based on their frequencies.
Language: C++
Purpose: Demonstrate the encoding and decoding process using Huffman coding.

Project Structure
include/:
huffman.h: Header file declaring functions and data structures for Huffman coding.
src/:
huffman.cpp: Implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm.
main.cpp: Main program for user interaction and execution of Huffman coding functions.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to ignore in the Git repository.

Features
Build Huffman Tree: Construct a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
Encode: Converts input text into a binary string using Huffman codes.
Decode: Optionally decodes the binary string back to the original text.
